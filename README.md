## Overview
**Job Percentage (Job%)** measures how efficiently teams convert high-leverage run-scoring situations into results (e.g., R2 with 0 outs; R3 with 0–1 outs). This repo contains the presentation, HTML, and reproducible code.

## Methods (1-paragraph)
This analysis uses Statcast data from the 2025 MLB regular season to quantify how often teams convert high-leverage run-scoring opportunities into results. Job Percentage (Job%) is computed from all plate appearances with a runner on second and no outs, or a runner on third with 0–1 outs. A separate playoff analysis uses postseason data from the 2022–2024 seasons to examine how situational efficiency differs under higher-pressure environments. I calculate each team’s Job% and use ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to test its relationship with total wins. Visualizations and regression outputs were produced in Python using pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and statsmodels.
